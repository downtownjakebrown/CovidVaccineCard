# CovidVaccineCard

## About

This project includes a simple iOS app for storing a digital copy of your COVID-19 vaccination details. This app is not intended to replace the paper vaccination card given to you when receiving your vaccination. Rather, it is meant to be used as a digital backup in case you lose your card, or don't have it with you. As always, please follow the guidance provided by our healthcare experts!

Apple requires apps related to COVID-19 to be published by a legal entity in the healthcare field (see [this notice](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03142020a)). So, as an individual developer, I cannot publish this application on the app store. But, feel free to download this project and install on your own device!
